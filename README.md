[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/borkenware/remote-auth-server.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/borkenware/remote-auth-server/blob/mistress/LICENSE)
A small, fast and secure microservice to easily provide remote authentication from a trusted device.

# This is a work in progress
Some links may 404 and there's only rough drafts for the time being.

## How to use it
### Server
TBD;

### Clients
You can find already existing clients (and info on how to contribute to them) [here](https://github.com/borkenware/remote-auth-clients).

The protocol specs can be found in `PROTOCOL.md`. Make sure to read it and implement it accordingly; some details in
your implementation will be the difference between a secure RA and an unsafe piece of software.
